This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(data.table)

### Reading data
data <- fread("repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv")

head(data)
```
```{r}
library(dplyr)

### Data manipulation to find out the total fatalities and injuries on human by types of events
data_evtype_population <- data.table(data %>% group_by(EVTYPE) %>% summarise_at(vars(FATALITIES,INJURIES), sum))

```

## Top events causing the most number of Humans' Fatalities & Injuries

```{r}
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)

data_evtype_population <- data_evtype_population[order(FATALITIES, INJURIES,decreasing=TRUE),.SD[1:5]]
data_q1 <- melt(data_evtype_population, ids.vars = c("EVTYPE"),measure.vars = c("FATALITIES","INJURIES"))
names(data_q1) <- c("Event Type", "Types" ,"Number of case")


ggplot(data_q1, aes(x=`Event Type`, y=`Number of case`, fill=`Types`))+
    geom_bar(stat='identity')
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Questions
Your data analysis must address the following questions:

Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
Consider writing your report as if it were to be read by a government or municipal manager who might be responsible for preparing for severe weather events and will need to prioritize resources for different types of events. However, there is no need to make any specific recommendations in your report.

Requirements
For this assignment you will need some specific tools

RStudio: You will need RStudio to publish your completed analysis document to RPubs. You can also use RStudio to edit/write your analysis.
knitr: You will need the knitr package in order to compile your R Markdown document and convert it to HTML
Document Layout
Language: Your document should be written in English.
Title: Your document should have a title that briefly summarizes your data analysis
Synopsis: Immediately after the title, there should be a synopsis which describes and summarizes your analysis in at most 10 complete sentences.
There should be a section titled Data Processing which describes (in words and code) how the data were loaded into R and processed for analysis. In particular, your analysis must start from the raw CSV file containing the data. You cannot do any preprocessing outside the document. If preprocessing is time-consuming you may consider using the cache = TRUE option for certain code chunks.
There should be a section titled Results in which your results are presented.
You may have other sections in your analysis, but Data Processing and Results are required.
The analysis document must have at least one figure containing a plot.
Your analysis must have no more than three figures. Figures may have multiple plots in them (i.e. panel plots), but there cannot be more than three figures total.
You must show all your code for the work in your analysis document. This may make the document a bit verbose, but that is okay. In general, you should ensure that echo = TRUE for every code chunk (this is the default setting in knitr).
Publishing Your Analysisless 
For this assignment you will need to publish your analysis on RPubs.com. If you do not already have an account, then you will have to create a new account. After you have completed writing your analysis in RStudio, you can publish it to RPubs by doing the following:

In RStudio, make sure your R Markdown document (.Rmd) document is loaded in the editor
Click the Knit HTML button in the doc toolbar to preview your document.
In the preview window, click the Publish button.
Once your document is published to RPubs, you should get a unique URL to that document. Make a note of this URL as you will need it to submit your assignment.

NOTE: If you are having trouble connecting with RPubs due to proxy-related or other issues, you can upload your final analysis document file as a PDF to Coursera instead.

Submitting Your Assignmentless 
In order to submit this assignment, you must copy the RPubs URL for your completed data analysis document in to the peer assessment question.

If you choose to submit as a PDF, please insert an obvious placeholder URL (e.g. https://google.com) in order to allow submission.
